dQuery
======
dQuery is a extremely lightweight DOM Manipulation library (like jQuery). Because dQuery uses vanilla API for complex operations, It's fast as hell and just 16kb (unminified).

dQuery aims to be 99.9% API compatible with jQuery, If you have existing jQuery code, there's a huge change that it will run on dQuery without any kind-of change. Even the jQuery plugins that you use on your website.

dQuery supports all the major browsers, even IE (I <3 Dinosaurs ).

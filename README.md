dQuery
======
dQuery is a extremely lightweight DOM Manipulation library (like jQuery). Because dQuery uses vanilla API for complex operations, It's fast as hell and just 16kb (unminified).

dQuery tries to be API compatible with jQuery and simple as much as possible, yet we have some incompatibilities, as well as some new features. [Check them out](Incompatibilities).

dQuery supports all the major browsers, except IE (I < / 3 Dinosaurs ).
